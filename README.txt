Collisions and springs don't seem to be working correctly. Both tend to explode. If I could get some feed back on my implementation of the collision force and the spring force equations would be greatly appreciated.
Additionally, r doesn't work to reset the simulation, a full reset must be performed. Sorry about that, I was having memory troubles from saving the initial data.
